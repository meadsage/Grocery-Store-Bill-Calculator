# Retail Management System

This project contains three separate C programs designed to manage various aspects of a retail business. Each program serves a different function from managing customer information to processing orders and maintaining stock records.

## Programs

1. **Customer ID** - Manages customer data, ensuring no duplicate IDs or usernames.
2. **Bill Calculator** - Processes orders and applies discounts, while updating item stocks dynamically.
3. **Stock** - Manages and displays current stock for various items.

## Getting Started

```bash
gcc program_name.c -o program_name
Eg. gcc customer_id.c -o customer_id
    gcc bill_calculator.c -o bill_calculator
    gcc stock.c -o stock

```
### Features
